# Movieland

**Movieland** is a simple movie search application that allows users to search for movies and display information about them. This project was created as part of my learning journey to practice fetching data from APIs, deploying React applications, and exploring React hooks like `useEffect`.

## Features
- Search for movies by title
- Fetch and display movie data from an external API
- Display basic information about movies like title and release year

## Learning Goals

1. **Fetching Data from an API**  
   One of my main objectives with Movieland was to practice fetching data from a third-party API. This helped me understand how to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript and integrate APIs into a React application.

2. **Exploring the `useEffect` Hook**  
   In this project, I explored Reactâ€™s `useEffect` hook to manage the side effect of fetching movie data when a search is performed. `useEffect` allowed me to handle lifecycle events efficiently, such as fetching data after the component mounts or when the search term changes.

3. **Deploying a React App using Netlify**  
   To make Movieland accessible online, I deployed the application using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). This was a great way to learn how to deploy React applications and ensure everything works seamlessly in a production environment.

## About the Movie Search Functionality

The app is currently set up to search for movies. However, due to the API used for testing, the search results primarily bring back older movies. This is a known limitation, as the API is not comprehensive or up to date with the latest movie releases. Future iterations of this project could incorporate a more robust API for more accurate and recent results.

## Deployment

The application is live on Netlify, and you can access it here: [Movieland Live](https://moiveland.netlify.app/).
